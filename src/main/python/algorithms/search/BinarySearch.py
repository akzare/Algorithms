  Example usage

  bs = BinarySearch()

  # EXAMPLE #1
  # Suppose we want to know what the square root of 875 is and
  # we have no knowledge of the wonderful Math.sqrt() function.
  # One approach is to use a binary search because we know that
  # the square root of 875 is bounded in the region: [0, 875].
  #
  # We can define our function to be f(x) = x*x and our target
  # value to be 875. As we binary search on f(x) approaching
  # successively closer values of 875 we get better and better
  # values of x (the square root of 875)

  lo = 0.0
  hi = 875.0
  target = 875.0
  sqr_fun = lambda x: x * x

  sqrtVal = bs.binarySearch(lo, hi, target, sqr_fun)
  print('sqrt({:.2f}) = {:.5f}, x^2 = {:.5f}\n'.format(target, sqrtVal, (sqrtVal * sqrtVal)))

  # EXAMPLE #2
  # Suppose we want to find the radius of a sphere with volume 100m^3 using
  # a binary search. We know that for a sphere the volume is given by
  # V = (4/3)*pi*r^3, so all we have to do is binary search on the radius.
  #
  # Note: this is a silly example because you could just solve for r, but it
  # shows how binary search can be a powerful technique.

  radiusLowerBound = 0
  radiusUpperBound = 1000
  volume = 100.0
  sphereVolumeFunction = lambda r: (4.0 / 3.0) * math.pi * r * r * r

  sphereRadius = bs.binarySearch(radiusLowerBound, radiusUpperBound, volume, sphereVolumeFunction)

  print('Sphere radius = {:.5f}\n'.format(sphereRadius))
